TASK 1 Construct a table with the following columns for any given YouTube channel's last 20 videos using R or Python. You can use any packages or modules you'd like. Hint: “Web scraping” may be a helpful thing to Google if you don’t know how to approach this. date published, video title, views, keywords, video id TASK 2 You will find Table A and Table B attached. Use R or Python to produce the following:

1. A set of rows in table A, but not table B. Specify the number in your answers.
2. A set of rows shared by tables A and B. Specify the number.
3. A joined set of rows in table A and B. Specify the number.
4. Use the last table obtained to do the following: a. Find out which day saw the highest number of videos published. b. Create a new variable that would label videos under 1M views as “small” and videos equal to or over 1M views as “big”. How many videos belong to each group? c. Create two graphs of your choosing and comment on your findings. d. Out of all these videos, which one has the highest views right now (rather than the time the data was recorded)? Please include your R or Python script(s) and a file with your answers in your submission.
